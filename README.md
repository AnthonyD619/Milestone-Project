# Title
    DeGuire's 21

# Description
    Hello, my name is Anthony DeGuire and my game is DeGuire's 21 also know as blackjack. The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21.

# Gameplay
  Initial Deal: Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards. Players' cards are typically dealt face up, while the dealer has one card face up and one card face down (the hole card).

  Player’s Turn: Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current hand). Players can also choose to "double down" (double their bet and receive one more card) or "split" (if they have a pair, split them into two separate hands).

  Dealer’s Turn: After all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card and must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher (this can vary slightly depending on the house rules).

  # Technologies
    I used the following languages to create my game: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

  # Technical Information

    The HTML and CSS files were written to create the layout and design of the page. In the Javascript file I used a number of variables and functions to start the game.

    The window.onload function creates a deck of cards, shuffles it and starts the game.

    The createDeck function initializes the deck with 52 cards combining each value with each suit.

    The shuffDeck function randomly shuffles the deck.

  # Issues
    Some issues I experienced when playing 21 were:

    - card images would not load
    - when clicking the "hit" button, the card would not get dealt.
    - player can still hit even after getting 21

    Some features I would like to add later is a bank where the player can bet chips and the bank adds the total winnings of player. Also I would like to add background music.
