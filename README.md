# Milestone-Project

Hello, my name is Anthony DeGuire and welcome to my milestone-project, 21, also known as blackjack.

There is not any inspiration behind the game, but I enjoy playing blackjack with friends and family at local casinos.

The objective of the game is to get 21 or as close as possible. Number cards keep their value, face cards (jack, queen, king, queen) are worth 10 and Aces are worth either 1 or 11
